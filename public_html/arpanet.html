    <h2>What Is The Full Form Of ARPANET?</h2>
    <p>The Full Form Of ARPANET is an Advanced Research Projects Agency NET.</p>
    <p>The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) is considered as a forerunner to the contemporary Internet. It was the first wide-area packet-switched network with shared control and also one of the primary channels to execute the TCP/IP protocol suite.</p>

    <h2>History of ARPANET</h2>
    <p>The ARPANET was a plan financed by the U.S. administration during the Cold War, to build a strong and secure communications network.</p>
    <p>ARPANET was established in 1969 by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the US Department of Defense. The whole idea was executed by sharing information using several computers.</p>
    <p>In the year 1980, ARPANET was delivered to various military networks, Defense Data Network.</p>

    <h2>Characteristics of ARPANET</h2>
    <p>It is considered a version of WAN.</p>
    <p>It utilized the theory of Packet Switching Network.</p>
    <p>It utilized Interface Message Processor for subnetting.</p>
    <p>The software of ARPANET was divided into two sections: a host and a subnet.</p>

  <h2>Benefits of ARPANET</h2>
  <p>It is unbelievable to know that the ARPANET was invented to serve in a Nuclear Attack.</p>
  <p>It was helping other technologies like collaborations through Emails.</p>
  <p>It improves the process of transfer of files and data, which ultimately makes the whole procedure smooth.</p>

  <h2>Limitations of ARPANET</h2>
<p>It required several LANs and due to that, it became difficult to handle it.</p>
<p>It was not able to cope up with improvements in technology.</p>

<h2>A packet of data</h2>
<p>ARPANET arose from a desire to share information over great distances without the need for dedicated phone connections between each computer on a network. As it turned out, fulfilling this desire would require “packet switching.”</p>
<p>Paul Baran, a researcher at the RAND Corporation think tank, first introduced the idea. Baran was instructed to come up with a plan for a computer communications network that could survive nuclear attack and continue functioning. He came up with a process that he called “hot-potato routing,” which later became known as packet switching.</p>
<p>“Packets” are small clusters of digital information broken up from larger messages for expediency’s sake. To illustrate in more recent terms: an e-mail might be split into numerous electronic packets of information and transmitted almost at random across the labyrinth of the nation’s telephone lines. They do not all follow the same route and do not even need to travel in proper sequential order. They are precisely reassembled by a modem at the receiver’s end, because each packet contains an identifying “header,” revealing which part of the larger message it represents, along with instructions for reconstituting the intended message. As a further safeguard, packets contain mathematical verification schemes that insure data does not get lost in transit. The network on which they travel, meanwhile, consists of computerized switches that automatically forward packets on to their destination. Data packets make computer communications more workable within existing telephone infrastructure by allowing all those packets to flow following paths of least resistance, thereby preventing logjams of digital data over direct, dedicated telephone lines.</p>

            The Dark Web refers to a series of Web sites that require special decryption and configuration tools to access. It is most commonly used for purposes that require strict anonymity, including illegal sales (e.g., of weapons and drugs), political dissent in countries with heavy censorship, and whistleblowing.

            While the Internet is theoretically decentralized and thus controlled by no single entity, many argue that tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google represent a small concentration of organizations that have unprecedented influence over the information and money on the Internet. In some countries, certain parts of the Internet are blocked via censorship.
