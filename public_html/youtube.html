            <h2>History of YouTube</h2>
            <p>YouTube was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. The trio were all early employees of
                PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay.Hurley had studied design
                at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the
                University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.
            </p>
            <p>Karim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show
                controversy, when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the
                halftime show. Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami
                online, which led to the idea of a video sharing site.</p>

            <h2>Features of YouTube</h2>
            <p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Video technology</li>
            <ul> YouTube primarily uses the VP9 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video codecs, and the Dynamic Adaptive
                Streaming over HTTP protocol.</ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Uploading</li>
            <ul> All YouTube users can upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration. Users can verify their
                account, normally through a mobile phone, to gain the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in
                length, as well as produce live streams.</ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Quality and formats</li>
            <ul> YouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level, displayed at a resolution of 320×240
                pixels using the Sorenson Spark codec (a variant of H.263),with mono MP3 audio.In March 2015,
                support for 4K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 3840 × 2160 pixels. In June 2015,
                support for 8K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels.</ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Live streaming</li>
            <ul> YouTube carried out early experiments with live streaming, including a concert by U2 in 2009, and a
                question-and-answer session with US President Barack Obama in February 2010. Live streams support
                HDR, can be up to 4K resolution at 60 fps, and also support 360° video.</ul>
            </p>

            <h2>User Features of YouTube</h2>
            <p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Community</li>
            <ul> On September 13, 2016, YouTube launched a public beta of Community, a social media-based feature
                that allows users to post text, images (including GIFs), live videos and others in a separate
                "Community" tab on their channel.Prior to the release, several creators had been consulted to
                suggest tools Community could incorporate that they would find useful; these YouTubers included
                Vlogbrothers, AsapScience, Lilly Singh, The Game Theorists, Karmin, The Key of Awesome, The Kloons,
                Peter Hollens, Rosianna Halse Rojas, Sam Tsui, Threadbanger and Vsauce3.</ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Comment System</li>
            <ul> Most videos enable users to leave comments, and these have attracted attention for the negative
                aspects of both their form and content.</ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Content accessibility</li>
            <ul> YouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website. Each
                YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of HTML that can be used to embed it on any page on the
                Web.This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and
                blogs. Users wishing to post a video discussing, inspired by, or related to another user's video can
                make a "video response".</ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Platforms</li>
            <ul> Most modern smartphones are capable of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or
                through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using RTSP streaming for the
                video.Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site</ul>

                            the ARPANET (an early prototype of the Internet), and Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn, who
                            developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) technologies.

                            providers. The widespread use of mobile broadband and Wi-Fi in the 21st century has
                            allowed this connection to be wireless.

                            doxxing. Many companies collect extensive information from users, which some deem a
