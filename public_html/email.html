    <h2>What is Electronic Mail?</h2>
    <p>Electronic mail (e-mail) is a computer-based application for the exchange of messages between users. A worldwide e-mail network allows people to exchange e-mail messages very quickly. E-mail is the electronic equivalent of a letter, but with advantages in timeliness and flexibility. While a letter will take from one day to a couple of weeks to be delivered, an e-mail is delivered to the intended recipient's mailbox almost instantaneously, usually in the multiple-second to subminute range. This is the case whether the e-mail is exchanged between people on the same floor of a business, or between friends at opposite points on the globe. This article provides a comprehensive, intermediate-level overview of e-mail, including its main functions, historical and current architectures, key standards, supporting infrastructure, and contemporary and future issues.</p>

    <p>However, e-mail quickly demonstrated some interesting additional social uses that further enhanced its attractiveness within organizational environments. Chief among these was the ability to find answers to organizational problems by using e-mail lists that made it relatively easy and convenient to transmit questions and consult those with whom one was not necessarily acquainted within the organizational community. Researchers have documented that electronic mail calls into existence and mobilizes a network of weak ties—distant and infrequently contacted others who possess potentially superior knowledge resources and who are frequently willing to provide information or advice as needed. A variety of factors motivate the helpful behavior of weak ties, including the ability to increase one's self-esteem, personal identification with the organization, and the organization's ability to foster a sense of employee citizenship and reciprocity.</p>

    <p>Further, researchers have argued that the use of e-mail reduces certain costs of decision making incurred whenever organizations bring employees together for face-to-face group communication. Such costs occur due to inherent inefficiencies of group communication. For example, individuals are able to produce more good ideas working alone than they can in brainstorming groups simply due to the amount of time required to take turns and listen to the ideas of others. Individuals brainstorming through electronic mail or chat, on the other hand, may express themselves continuously, taking brief breaks to read the contributions of others.</p>

<p>Online interactions can produce written archives of discussion and their ongoing quality can help to maintain the momentum of the group over time. Online interaction also appears to stimulate a more equal distribution of talk, as group members are less likely to be inhibited by status, gender, and power cues that are prominent in face-to-face communication. Designers of software and hardware systems called group decision support systems have sought to capitalize on these advantages through the development of technologies that provide guided sequences of interaction aimed at producing high quality organizational decisions.</p>

<p>One of the first theories generated to account for how managers in organizations use electronic mail in organizations was the media richness theory. Developed as a more general theory of media use in organizations, media richness theory was adapted in the early 1980s to advance some claims about the potential role of electronic mail in organizational task accomplishment when compared to that of other organizational media choices. Essentially, the theory suggests that organizational tasks require different types of information, and organizational media are differentially useful in helping individuals to process these types of information. The theory makes some descriptive claims about how savvy managers actually select communication media for task accomplishment, which become the basis for normative claims about how managers should select communication media for task accomplishment.</p>

<p>More specifically, the theory posits that some organizational decisions can be made on the basis of lean information, or information that is relatively unambiguous and not subject to multiple interpretation; such information can be communicated through a small number of channels. However, other organizational decisions require information that is rich; that is, information that carries with it greater degrees of uncertainty, that is potentially equivocal or capable of being interpreted in potentially conflicting ways, and that requires substantial interpretation and feedback in order to be used wisely. Rich information requires interpretation at a number of levels and, beyond language, must be communicated through a number of channels.</p>

            The Internet consists of technologies developed by different individuals and organizations. Important figures include Robert W. Taylor, who led the development of the ARPANET (an early prototype of the Internet), and Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn, who developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) technologies.

            The Internet works through a series of networks that connect devices around the world through telephone lines. Users are provided access to the Internet by Internet service providers. The widespread use of mobile broadband and Wi-Fi in the 21st century has allowed this connection to be wireless.

            The advent of the Internet has brought into existence new forms of exploitation, such as spam e-mail and malware, and harmful social behaviour, such as cyberbullying and doxxing. Many companies collect extensive information from users, which some deem a violation of privacy.

            The Dark Web refers to a series of Web sites that require special decryption and configuration tools to access. It is most commonly used for purposes that require strict anonymity, including illegal sales (e.g., of weapons and drugs), political dissent in countries with heavy censorship, and whistleblowing.

            While the Internet is theoretically decentralized and thus controlled by no single entity, many argue that tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google represent a small concentration of organizations that have unprecedented influence over the information and money on the Internet. In some countries, certain parts of the Internet are blocked via censorship.
