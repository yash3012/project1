            <h2>What is Wi-Fi?</h2>
            <p>Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices such as computers (laptops and
                desktops), mobile devices (smart phones and wearables), and other equipment (printers and video
                cameras) to interface with the Internet. It allows these devices--and many more--to exchange
                information with one another, creating a network.
            </p>
            <p>Internet connectivity occurs through a wireless router. When you access Wi-Fi, you are connecting to
                a wireless router that allows your Wi-Fi-compatible devices to interface with the Internet..</p>
            <img src="img/wifi-logo.png" class="rounded float-left w-50 d-block m-auto" alt="internet">

            <h2>What does Wi-Fi mean?</h2>
            <p>Wi-Fi is not an acronym; it is a brand name created by a marketing firm thatâ€™s meant to serve as an
                interoperability seal for marketing efforts.
            </p>

            <h2>How does Wi-Fi work?</h2>
            <p>On the technical side, the IEEE 802.11 standard defines the protocols that enable communications with
                current Wi-Fi-enabled wireless devices, including wireless routers and wireless access points.
                Wireless access points support different IEEE standards. Each standard is an amendment that was
                ratified over time. The standards operate on varying
                frequencies, deliver different bandwidth, and support different numbers of channels.</p>


            <h2>What is a wireless router?</h2>
            <p>Wireless routers are commonly found in homes. They're the hardware devices that Internet service
                providers use to connect you to their cable or xDSL Internet network.

                A wireless router is sometimes referred to as a wireless local area network (WLAN) device. A
                wireless network is also called a Wi-Fi network.</p>

            <h2>Uses of Wi-Fi</h2>
            <p>
            <li>Internet</li>
            <li>City-wide</li>
            <li>Geolocation</li>
            <li>Motion detection</li>
            </p>
            <h2>Benefits of Wi-Fi</h2>
            <p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Wireless Ethernet</li>
            <ul> Wi-Fi is an Ethernet replacement. Wi-Fi and Ethernet, both IEEE 802 networks, share some core
                elements. </ul>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Extended Access</li>
            <ul>The absence of wires and cables extends access to places where wires and cables cannot go or where
                it is too expensive for them to go.</ul>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Reduction</li>
            <ul>
                As mentioned above, the absence of wires and cables brings down cost. This is accomplished by a
                combination of factors, the relatively low cost of wireless routers, no need for trenching, drilling
                and other methods that may be necessary to make physical connections.
            </ul>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Mobility</li>
            <ul>
                Wires tie you down to one location. Going wireless means you have the freedom to change your
                location without losing your connection.
            </ul>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Flexibility</li>
            <ul>
                Extended access, cost reductions, and mobility create opportunities for new applications as well as
                the possibility of creative new solutions for legacy applications.
            </ul>
            </p>

                            doxxing. Many companies collect extensive information from users, which some deem a
