            <h2>What is Computer Virus?</h2>
            <p>A computer virus is a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates
                and is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or attaching
                itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code.</p>
            <h2>How does the virus inserts? </h2>
            <p>Routes of infection are through attached files, downloaded files from websites, external storage
                media, etc. These days, a new type of virus has emerged which infects files when certain websites
                are merely visited, so a digital environment without antivirus software is quite dangerous.</p>
            <h2>How do computer virus attack?</h2>
            <p>
                Once a virus has successfully attached to a program, file, or document, the virus will lie dormant
                until circumstances cause the computer or device to execute its code. In order for a virus to infect
                your computer, you have to run the infected program, which in turn causes the virus code to be
                executed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that a virus can remain dormant on your computer, without showing major signs or
                symptoms. However, once the virus infects your computer, the virus can infect other computers on the
                same network. Stealing passwords or data, logging keystrokes, corrupting files, spamming your email
                contacts, and even taking over your machine are just some of the devastating and irritating things a
                virus can do.
            </p>

            <h2>How do computer virus spread?</h2>
            <p>Viruses can be spread through email and text message attachments, Internet file downloads, and social
                media scam links. Your mobile devices and smartphones can become infected with mobile viruses
                through shady app downloads. Viruses can hide disguised as attachments of socially shareable content
                such as funny images, greeting cards, or audio and video files.</p>

            <h2>How to identify if your computer has virus?</h2>
            <p>
            <li>Frequent pop-up windows</li>
            <li>Changes to your homepage</li>
            <li>Mass emails being sent from your email account</li>
            <li>Frequent crashes</li>
            <li>Unusually slow computer performance</li>
            <li>Unknown programs that start up when you turn on your computer</li>
            <li>Unusual activities like password changes</li>

            <h2>How to protect against computer virus?</h2>
            <p>
            <li>Use an Anti-Virus software</li>
            <li>Avoid clicking on any pop-up advertisements</li>
            <li>Always scan your email attachments before opening them</li>

                            doxxing. Many companies collect extensive information from users, which some deem a
