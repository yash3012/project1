    <h3>Single Responsibility Principle : </h3>
    <p>This states that a class should have a single responsibility, but more than that,
       a class should only have one reason to change. Here the calculator.py class has only one task to do. That
       is to call the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division method. The actual calculations are being
       performed in their respective classes which is being inherited by the calculator.py class.
    </p>
    <img src="img/solid-S.png" class="border border-3">
 
    <h3>Open/Closed Principle : </h3>
    <p>In the open/closed principle classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
       Essentially meaning that classes should be extended to change functionality, rather than being altered into
       something else. In our case, the addition function when initially created only added 2 numbers. after that,
       we refactored the method, and added such functionality that it can add in more than two numbers. However,
       we cannot make this method perform another type of calculation such as multiplication. For that we need
       to change that calculation's respective class method.
    </p>
    <img src="img/solid-O.png" class="border border-3">

    <h3>Liskov Substitution Principle : </h3>
    <p>This states that objects should be replaceable by their subtypes without altering how the program works.
       In other words, derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes without causing errors.
       In our case, we can see in the above picture that Addition.py class extends Calculation.py class.
       It is able to perform all the functions that Calculation.py class can perform and on top of that,
       it can also perform the addition function as well.
    </p>

    <h3>Interface Segregation Principle : </h3>
    <p>This states that many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
       In other words, classes should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use. In our calculator example
       we really dont have such implementation but in a general sense, we should have a class which only has one function
       or method that performs a single task and that class is inherited by multiple classes. For example, we can have
       a class that prints the result but with one change that it always doubles the result. Now that class can be called
       for any four or all four calculation class and when we use that class method to print the result, the result will
       always be double of the actual result.</p>

    <h3>Dependency Inversion Principle</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the simplest of the principles, this states that classes should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
       Explicit is better than Implicit. In our case, the parent class "Calculations.py" is not dependent on its child
       class which is "Addition.py" but rather it relies on the abstract implementation of the child class's
       get_result() method. The parent class is not dependent on how the get_result() is implemented in the child class.</p>
