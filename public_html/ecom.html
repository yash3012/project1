    <h2>What is E-Commerce explain with example?</h2>
    <p>
      eCommerce (also known as electronic commerce) is the process of buying and selling products or services, making money transfers, and transferring data over an electronic medium (Internet). This network allows people to do business without the constraint of distance and time</p>
    <h2>What are the 3 types of e-commerce?</h2>
  <p>There are three main types of e-commerce: business-to-business (websites such as Shopify), business-to-consumer (websites such as Amazon), and consumer-to-consumer (websites such as eBay).</p>

  <h2>Increased Sales With Instant Gratification</h2>
  <p>For businesses that sell digital goods, eCommerce allows the delivery of products within seconds of making a purchase. This satisfies consumers' need for instant gratification and helps increase sales, especially for low-cost items that are often "impulse buys."</p>


<h2>How ecommerce came to be</h2>
<p>The first ecommerce transaction was made in 1994. A guy named Phil Brandenberger used his Mastercard to buy Sting’s Ten Summoners’ Tales via the internet for $12.48. This particular transaction made history and signaled to the world that the “internet is open” for ecommerce transactions. Why? Because it was the first time that encryption technology was used to enable an internet purchase.</p>

<p>Needless to say, ecommerce has grown by leaps and bounds ever since. The rise of ecommerce giants like Amazon and Alibaba in the mid -1990s changed the face of the retail industry. They largely capitalized on the global internet penetration and digitalization of the financial system which contributed to the decline in sales for many brick-and-mortar businesses.</p>

<p>The growth of ecommerce has also shifted the retail workforce. The U.S Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) has revealed that from 1997 to 2016, employment in the ecommerce sector  increased by 80%. BLS is also predicting that the number of ecommerce jobs will keep on growing and reach 450,000 in the US by 2026. </p>

<p>Taking this into account, it’s clear that the highly competitive nature of ecommerce will keep on changing the retail industry and influence customers’ behaviour. Starting an online business nowadays seems like an attractive idea for many savvy entrepreneurs, but before anyone dives into this dynamic business sector, they first need to learn the ropes of the ecommerce industry.</p>

            The Internet consists of technologies developed by different individuals and organizations. Important figures include Robert W. Taylor, who led the development of the ARPANET (an early prototype of the Internet), and Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn, who developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) technologies.

            The Internet works through a series of networks that connect devices around the world through telephone lines. Users are provided access to the Internet by Internet service providers. The widespread use of mobile broadband and Wi-Fi in the 21st century has allowed this connection to be wireless.

            The advent of the Internet has brought into existence new forms of exploitation, such as spam e-mail and malware, and harmful social behaviour, such as cyberbullying and doxxing. Many companies collect extensive information from users, which some deem a violation of privacy.

            The Dark Web refers to a series of Web sites that require special decryption and configuration tools to access. It is most commonly used for purposes that require strict anonymity, including illegal sales (e.g., of weapons and drugs), political dissent in countries with heavy censorship, and whistleblowing.

            While the Internet is theoretically decentralized and thus controlled by no single entity, many argue that tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google represent a small concentration of organizations that have unprecedented influence over the information and money on the Internet. In some countries, certain parts of the Internet are blocked via censorship.
